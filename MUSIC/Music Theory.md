**Notes**  
Note is the building block of music.

Total notes = 12 (7+5)  
Natural notes = 7 -> C D E F G A B  
Accidental Notes = 5 ->  C#(Db)  D#(Eb)  F#(Gb)  G#(Ab)  A#(Bb)

B and E doesn't have sharp (why?) 

In case of piano, white keys play natural notes and black keys play sharp(#) or flat(b) notes.

# Interval

An interval is a distance between two notes.  
C  C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G  G#  A  A#  B  C

- Half step interval = one semitone
- Whole step interval = two semitones = tone

Diminished - Step back  
Augmented - Step Forward

C -> C# = minor 2nd (half step)  
C -> D = Major 2nd (whole step)  
C -> D# = minor 3rd ⭐  
C -> E = Major 3rd ⭐  
C -> F = Perfect 4th  
C -> F# = Tritone (three tone jump)\
C -> G = Perfect 5th ⭐\
C -> G# = minor 6th\
C -> A = Major 6th\
C -> A# = minor 7th\
C -> B = Major 7th\
C -> C = Octave

# Chords 
Major = Root -> M3 -> P5  
Minor = Root -> m3 ->P5

Example  
C chord  
1 -> Root i.e. C  
2 ->  
.       take a note with min interval (m3) for C Minor = D#  
.       take a note with max interval (M3) for C Major = E  
3 -> Perfect 5th of root i.e G

What are the different types of chords?
