Well well !! Who wasn't a fan of his mind palace technique?  
After watching the episode, I thought, "I could totally do this!"  But soon enough, I realized… my brain is more like a junk drawer than a super-organized storage system.

So, I gave up on the idea of becoming the next Sherlock Holmes (sadly) — instead I decided to create my own version of a mind palace in the little corner of internet.

Welcome to my digital mind palace! This place is more of a _digital_ mess of my knowledge and random bits of info. (spoiler alert: I’m not that organized)

Feel free to poke around :)
