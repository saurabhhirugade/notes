Ever watched Sherlock and thought, ‘Yeah, I can totally do that whole Mind Palace thing’? Yeah, me too. But then I realized… my brain is more like a junk drawer than a super-organized storage system.

So, I gave up on becoming the next Sherlock Holmes—until I realized, hey, why not build a digital Mind Palace instead?

Welcome to my digital mess of knowledge and random stuff. Feel free to poke around, but remember—this place might be organized, but it’s definitely not that organized -- make yourself at home :)
