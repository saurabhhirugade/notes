Ever watched Sherlock and thought, ‘Yeah, I can totally do that whole Mind Palace thing’? But then I realized… my brain is more like a junk drawer than a super-organized storage system.

So, I gave up on the idea of becoming the next Sherlock Holmes — until I realized, hey, why not build a digital Mind Palace instead?

Welcome to my digital mess of knowledge and random stuff. 
Feel free to poke around :)
