Class: Class is a blueprint or a set of instructions to build a specific type of object.  
Object: Object is an instance of a class.  

Generally class consists of constructor, data and methods.

[[Constructor]] -> a special method (same name as class) used to instantiate (create) an object of class.  
Date stored -> State variable / Data Member / Property of that class  
Actions performed  -> Method / Behaviour / Function of that class

Example:  
**Class:**  Car  
**Objects**: Mercedes, BMW, Toyota  
**Data Member:** Price, Speed, Wheels, Mileage, Model, Colour  
**Member Function**: brakes(), accelerate(), start(), stop()

Four pillars of Object Oriented Programming:
1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. Polymorphism


*Do a [[SOLID]] check whenever creating a class.*
